<h1>Windows Forms App</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
This project consisted of creating a Windows Forms Application to manage customers and appointments using a MySQL Database Connection.  Consultants sign in with a username and password, add/edit/delete customers, add/edit/delete customer appointments for consultants, and contains date pickers and hour constraints for scheduling appointments.
